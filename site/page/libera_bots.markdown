| perlbotdev | simcop2387 | <nobr>@perlbot/bot/simcop2387/perlbotdev</nobr> | A seldom used development version of perlbot, used when doing stuff that will be disruptive to normal bot operations                                                                                          |
| metabot    | simcop2387 | <nobr>@perlbot/bot/simcop2387/metabot</nobr>  | An in development bot for logging and auditing chanop behavior.  Will log channel messages but those logs will not be public                                                                                  |
| meatbot    | simcop2387 | <nobr>@perlbot/bot/simcop2387/meatbot</nobr>  | An alternate name for metabot that will be used for dev versions/work for the time being, but eventually as an alternate nick for expanding to more channels                                                  |
| farnsworth | simcop2387 | <nobr>@perlbot/bot/simcop2387/farnsworth</nobr> | A bot that speaks only [Language::Farnsworth](https://metacpan.org/pod/Language::Farnsworth)                                                                                                                  |
| cubert     | simcop2387 | <nobr>@perlbot/bot/simcop2387/cubert</nobr>  | A similar bot to farnsworth that speaks a slightly updated version of [Language::Farnsworth](https://metacpan.org/pod/Language::Farnsworth).  The changes are really minor and won't affect anything normally |
| candide    | pragma-    | <nobr>@about/c/bot/candide-</nobr>  | Another featureful bot writen in perl with lots of features. https://github.com/pragma-/pbot                                                                                                                  |
